  <h1> Kidnapping and deportation: Russian occupants forcefully moved more than 200,000 children from Ukraine</h1>
   <h3>Number of children abducted</h3>
    <p><q><strong>More than 1 million 185 thousand of our citizens</strong>, including <strong>more than 200,000 children</strong> were moved to the territory of the russian federation</q>Lyudmyla Denisova, the Ukrainian parliamentary envoy for human rights said at a briefing in Kyiv. </p>
      <h3>Further fate</h3>
      <p>The deportees are taken and distributed all over russia, especially in the poor regions so that they help develop the economy. Besides, putin uses the captured Ukrainians for propaganda,<i>“so as to film the TV stories about their escape from Ukraine and russia’s protection”</i>. The Ukrainian ombudsman claims that, russians create filtration camps in the temporarily occupied territories where they interrogate Ukrainians and ask them what they thought about the <i>«russian mission»</i> in Ukraine.</p> 
      <p>Furthermore, russia resorts to illegal <i>«adoption»</i> of minors brought from Ukraine. Russian ministry of education plans to sign <i>«agreements»</i> with russian occupant administrations in Donetsk and Luhansk regions; according to these documents, orphaned children who were deported from our territory will be adopted by russian families. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry described the threat of illegal adoption of Ukrainian minors as «outrageous».</p>
